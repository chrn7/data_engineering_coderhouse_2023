TP 1: Extract data from Youtube API and create a table in Redshift including the extracted and transformed information

The objective of this Project is to extract the Data from Youtube API to get the Top 10 Videos by View_Counts from each day of execution and create a table in Redshift showing the extracted and transformed information (taking the data from Youtube API as input source).
The Table of Results from Youtube API will show the Top 10 Videos which currently have more View_Counts (more visualizations).
